<p>This website was built to showcase the vertical menu and my current capabilities in HTML/CSS. As you can see, I'm not the best at creating webpages. 
I personally find Java to be much easier and more straight forward than HTML and CSS which have more elements than there are stars in our galaxy. Not to
mention literally everytime I try to do something, it backfires completely. If I'm completely honest, I am slightly worried about the final project. How
the hell am I expected to make anything good when this is the best I could do. The thing about Java is that there's multiple ways to solve a problem. However,
HTML really only has one proper way of doing it which can lead to me inadvertedly breaking something when fixing something else. </p>

<p>She was taking attendance, and she looked up and said “are we missing anyone?” I said “Yeah, Joe” She said “who’s joe” I dropped it on her. 
“Joe mama!” Instantly she dialed 911. I was led out of the class in cuffs to the principals office. 
He expelled me. I was then transported to the court house, where the judge gave me life with no parole. 
There’s talk of executing me. I’m now on 3 different watchlists. I’m writing this post from a prison computer. 
Don’t Joe mama your teacher.</p>

<p>My name is Justin. I'm a first year at Champlain in the Computer Science Program. I got into the program because I've always been fascinated by computers and I've wanted
to go into a job like software or game development where I can do just that. As you can see from this webpage, CSS is not my strong point and I'm no web designer. However, I do
try and complete all the assignments we have to do. When I'm not doing school work, you can usually find me playing Fallout 4 or some other game on my steam. Below are my github, twitter
and Steam links.</p>
